## This is a quick hack to put a OOBE-gold-image version of the OS on the other slot and mark it active for next reboot,
## so we can test the flow of then updating from it to a day-1 update.

# Usage:
#   steamos-prepare-oobe-test
#   # Optionally also arm the factory reset machinery to get a 'clean' install into the factory image, for more thorough
#   # testing
#   steamos-factory-reset-config
#   # Reboot into new factory image, which will 'update' back to the latest stable image.
#   reboot

# The URL to query to determine what OOBE image to grab
OOBE_IMAGE_VER_URL="https://steamdeck-images.steamos.cloud/steamdeck/latest-oobe-test-image.txt"
# Where to get it, since we'll ask rauc directly.  Assumes two replacements currently.
OOBE_IMAGE_URL_PAT="https://steamdeck-images.steamos.cloud/steamdeck/%s/steamdeck-%s-snapshot.raucb"
